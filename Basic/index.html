  <h3>Basic JS code Structure</h3>
  <h4>Semicolon</h4>
  <p>Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions.
    We’ve already seen a statement, alert('Hello, world!'), which shows the message “Hello, world!”.  
    We can have as many statements in our code as we want. Statements can be separated with a semicolon.</p>
  <h4>Comments : </h4>
    <ul>
      <p> It becomes necessary to add comments which describe what the code does and why.

        Comments can be put into any place of a script. They don't affect its execution because the engine simply ignores them.</p>
        <p>There is 2 types of comments in JS :</p>
        <li>Single line </li>
        <li>Multi Line</li>
    </ul>
